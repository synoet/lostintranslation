              {`As I conversed with an old friend from Ukraine, I was struck by
              the sadness in her eyes as she told me about her grandfather's
              recent passing. Though we both spoke Russian, my language skills
              had unfortunately deteriorated over the years, and her English was
              not perfect either. Despite trying to console her, I struggled to
              find the right words in Russian. I knew exactly what I wanted to
              say in English - phrases like "Everything will be okay" or "I'm
              sorry to hear that; I know they are in a good place now" - but as
              I tried to translate these sentiments directly, I couldn't help
              feeling that the empathy and compassion I wanted to convey was
              getting lost in translation. All I could manage was a simple
              "прости" (sorry) and a weak "все будет хорошо" (everything will be
              okay). It was as if the emotion and sentiment I wanted to express
              were stuck in my head, unable to find their way out through my
              flawed Russian.`}

            In the United States, the increasing diversity of its population has
            made language translation a vital issue. According to the 2018
            census, 67.3 million people in the US spoke a language other than
            English at home – a number that has almost tripled since 1990. In a
            country that is becoming more diverse every day, it is important to
            find solutions that allow us to maintain our identity and culture
            while also enabling us to communicate effectively with people from
            different backgrounds.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-4 font-libre leading-7">
            In recent years, powerful tools like Google Translate have made
            translation more accessible to everyone. We can now translate any
            text or phrase from any language at the touch of a button, a task
            that would have required sifting through hundreds of pages of a
            translation book just a decade ago.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-4 font-libre leading-7">
            Translation is not just about having conversations with each other –
            it is essential in every aspect of life, from understanding bills,
            papers, and even your rights within a country. While we have made
            great strides in simplifying translation, current solutions still
            lack the intuition and perception of a human translator. While
            convenient for quickly translating text, verbatim translation
            services like Google Translate often fail to capture the nuance,
            context, and sentiment of the original language, leading to
            confusion and misunderstandings for non-English speakers. This can
            be particularly dangerous in situations where the accuracy of a
            translation is critical, such as with legal documents.

            Large Language Models have become exceptionally popular recently and
            have gained a sense of virality due to chat.openai.com or chatGPT.
            While some people draw comparisons between this and search engines
            like google, they are completely wrong. Large Language Models are
            like a person with an enormous amount of context and knowledge
            stored in their head. Using this context and knowledge, similar to
            how we build responses to prompts, it tries to predict and generate
            the most likely response. Because of this, It has the exceptional
            ability to have a pseudo sense of perception by using context as a
            foundation for responses. Because of this, it can provide
            translations that are contextually aware and do not lack context or
            nuance.

            The literal translation is correct, but this phrase might be lost on
            a native german speaker unfamiliar with the meaning of the English
            phrase. Let’s try again, but this time, we will prompt an LLM
            (gpt-3) to provide us with a contextual translation of meaning and

            As you can see, the contextually aware translation provides someone

            significantly more information to understand what the other party is
            conveying. This is because LLMs can build a contextual understanding
            of a phrase, as opposed to just a word-to-word translation.
